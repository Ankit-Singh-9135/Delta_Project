    <p>I MET a traveller from an antique land<br>
        Who said:â€”Two vast and trunkless legs of stone<br>
        Stand in the desert. Near them on the sand,<br>
        Half sunk, a shatter'd visage lies, whose frown<br>
        And wrinkled lip and sneer of cold command 5<br>
        Tell that its sculptor well those passions read<br>
        Which yet survive, stamp'd on these lifeless things,<br>
        The hand that mock'd them and the heart that fed.<br>
        And on the pedestal these words appear:<br>
        "My name is Ozymandias, king of kings: 10<br>
        Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair!"<br>
        Nothing beside remains: round the decay<br>
        Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare,<br>
        The lone and level sands stretch far away.<br>
        </p>
